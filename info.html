                <h3>Day of Information</h3>
                <p>Registered crawlers,</p>

                <p>The 18th Annual Crawl is near. Begin your mental and physical preparations. Dust off those dancing
                    shoes.</p>

                <p>Here's how things will go down on Saturday the 10th.</p>

                <p>PLEASE read all the way to the end as there is some very important information down there. A good
                    crawler is an informed crawler. Don't blow it.</p>

                <p>I don't have everyone's email address so be sure to check with your buddies and make sure they're in
                    the
                    loop. Details here too:</p>

                </p>

                <p>If you have some friends that still want to join our caravan, I have extra shirts available. Sizes
                    are
                    as follows, $35, first come first serve. Email me.</p>

                <p>Small: 2<br>
                    Medium: 5<br>
                    Large: 9<br>

                <p>=============================================================</p>

                <p>General Info:</p>

                <p>2:00 PM -- The PUB CRAWL BEGINS at Mary's Place.</p>

                <p>Mary's serves as the center for t-shirt distribution and marks the beginning of our fellowship.</p>

                <p>Please show up if you want your t-shirt. I'm not bringing the backpack of unclaimed shirts out this
                    year
                    because it sucks and I like to enjoy the crawl too. If you ordered one, show up to get it. The
                    shirts
                    are a big part of NPC tradition, please respect that.</p>

                <p>Mary's Place also hosts our world famous Golden Ticket raffle. The drawing begins after the arrival
                    of
                    our 30th patron. Winner claims $100 party cash. Come enjoy the friendly confines.</p>

                <p>Our timekeeper runs a tight ship. Don't be late. It's best to not anger him early.</p>

                <p>Here's the tentative time schedule:</p>

                <p>1:00pm - 2:00pm - OPTIONAL - Mary's Place Welcome Picnic<br>
                    2:00pm - 3:45pm - Mary's Place<br>
                    3:50pm - 4:50pm - Filonek's<br>
                    4:55pm - 5:40pm - The Garage<br>
                    5:40pm - 6:35pm - Jet's<br>
                    6:45pm - 10:05pm - Three Counties (pizza, band, chalice presentation, dance party)</p>

                <p>I met with all the bars and they are excited for us to come, they know me and know that we always
                    have a
                    good group of people. Please be respectful of the bars and the surrounding neighborhoods. It's
                    appreciated by all. Keep it classy.</p>

                <p>=============================================================</p>

                <p>Food:</p>

                <p>We will be filling our mouths with Papa Joe's Pizza during our stop at The Three Counties. Papa Joe's
                    is
                    a neighborhood favorite and never disappoints. It's a big hit on the crawl and I've received many
                    excellent reviews. Feeding time is around 7:00 pm.</p>

                <p>Entertainment:</p>

                <p>Our house band, HOYH4J, is ready to melt our minds all over again!</p>

                <p>The show starts around 7:30 PM. Standing room only.</p>

                <p>Dance Party:</p>

                <p>The one, the only. Don't miss it. Experience human contact!</p>

                <p>The dance party starts around 9:00 PM.</p>

                <p>=============================================================</p>

                <p>Open Bags \\ Jumbo Jenga \\ Welcome Picnic:</p>

                <p>1:00 PM (optional)</p>

                <p>Mary's Place hosts our Welcome Picnic on their patio around 1pm. They roll out the red carpet and
                    usually grill up some dogs for us.</p>

                <p>We decided to retire the formal bags tournament a few years ago. That being said, we know there are
                    still some players in the field that would like to throw some flapjacks. We'll have the boxes out.
                    Come
                    challenge the greats. Gambling optional. All are welcome.</p>

                <p>In addition to bags, we'll also have some Jumbo Jenga going. Test your skills! Talk to people in real
                    life!</p>
